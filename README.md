# React Router DOM v6 Intermittent Routing Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in React Router DOM v6 where routes fail to render correctly or navigation behaves unexpectedly.  The problem is intermittent, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.

## Bug Description

The application uses `react-router-dom` v6 to manage navigation.  In some instances, navigating between routes results in a blank screen or the incorrect component being rendered.  The behavior is not consistent, making debugging challenging.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Steps to Reproduce (Inconsistent)

While the bug is not consistently reproducible, navigating rapidly between the Home and About pages might trigger the issue.  This is not a reliable way to replicate the error, however.

## Potential Causes

Potential causes include:

* Improper use of React Router's API.
* Conflicts with other libraries.
* Timing issues (race conditions) that cause components to mount and update out of sync.

## Solution

The solution is included in the `bugSolution.js` file.  This is the fixed code which might help to understand better.  Further investigation is needed to provide a more robust and reliable solution.
